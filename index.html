         <h2>About me</h2> 
   
         <p>I am a first year graphic design student at Algonquin College. I am a very social person and I love meetinng new people. I play lots of video games when I have time and I used to run track and play hockey. I haven't had as much time for those activities recently due to school however I still find them fun when I get to do them.</p>

         <p>I have around 4 years of design experience with 4 classes in high school, the design foundations program at Algonquin College, and now the graphic design program at Algonquin as well. This class has been my first experience with coding and although I thought it was extremely intimidating, after understanding how all the tags and different lines work, I realized it's not just a crazy amount of random stuff piled up on a page. I am excited to learn more about coding in the years to come!</p>
